# character-manager


### Project made with Jean-FranÃ§ois Stassen to manage a database of comics characters.

As usual, we made the best we were able to, we didn't let it go, but we couldn't achieve the fixed goals.
I was unable to deploy the website on Netlify and on GitHubPages, i don't know why but all the typescript part does not work, i can't explain.

Anyway, there is still a way to look at what we made.

Clone this repository then use the **command** 

> parcel home.html

Then open your **browser** and use the **url**
>localhost:1234

It should work. If it's not, let me know.

We created a home page with every characters aviable in the API. From this page, you can click a button to access a create-page, on wich you can create your own new character (click the "create" button only once, then come back on the home page.
From the home page, you can also delete a character or show a new page for a single character.

Thank you for reading. If you have tips, feel free to tell us, we'll take then with pleasure, all we want now is to learn.
